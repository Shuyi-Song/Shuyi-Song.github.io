Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am a research assistant at Center for Experimental Economics in Education (CEEE). I obtained my Master's degree in Experimental Economics from Shaanxi Normal University in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Yaojiang Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZtZi5T8AAAAJ&hl=en), and my Bachelor's degree in Food Quality and Safety from Northwest A&F University in 2019.

My research interests include maternal and child health, as well as health systems in China and other low-and middle-income countries, with a focus on quality, equity, and access to healthcare.
