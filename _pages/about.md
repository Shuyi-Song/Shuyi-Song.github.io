Hello! Welcome to my webpage. I am a research assistant at the Center for Experimental Economics in Education (CEEE), advised by [Dr. Jingchun Nie](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jingchun-Nie). I obtained my Master's degree in Experimental Economics from Shaanxi Normal University in 2022, supervised by [Prof. Yaojiang Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZtZi5T8AAAAJ&hl=en), and my Bachelor's degree in Food Quality and Safety from Northwest A&F University in 2019.


Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in health economics, public policy, and global development. Currently, my research focuses on maternal and child health, and health systems in low-and middle-income countries, with an emphasis on quality, equity, and access to healthcare.
