About me
======
Welcome to my website. I am a PhD student in Health Policy and Management with a minor in Economics at UNC Chapel Hill, supervised by [Dr. Sean Yuji Sylvia](https://ssylvia.io/). I obtained my MSc in Experimental Economics from Shaanxi Normal University, supervised by [Dr. Yaojiang Shi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ZtZi5T8AAAAJ&hl=en), and my BEng in Food Quality and Safety from Northwest A&F University.


Research Interests
======
I am broadly interested in digital health and global development. Currently, my research focuses on maternal and child health, and health systems in low-and middle-income countries, with an emphasis on quality, equity, and access to healthcare.
